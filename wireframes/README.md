# The Monkees project

This is a project for User Centric Frontend Development.
This page is built to introduce new users with the band and existing ones
to refresh their knowledge about the band or simply just enjoy their legacy of some legendary songs.

## UX

My goal was to make clean, simple and easy to use page.
I used mostly few shades of grey to avoid too much strong colors 
from 60's to achieve a calm environment for users.
Easy to navigate and to follow the links.
This project contains 1 scolling page.

- This website is for made for fans of The Monkees
- Users can learn all about their history
- They can listen the podcasts on spotify
- They can connect with their social media pages (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube)
- They can hire them for parties trough contact form

## Features and info

- Navbar
I used same navbar for all the pages
Simple Navbar wich extends in a mobile phone size 
- About us page
Few img in containers with text from wikipedia
on the end there is 4 cards with img of the band members
black and white ones represent 2 deceased members and in color still living
all of them have link to their wikipedia biography
- Multimedia
Istead of audio material provided i choose spotify and (audio material provided was faulty)
- Footer 
Hovering above social media icons it changes color to their traditional colors
- Font style
I used 'Pacifico', cursive style, just to make it unique and to blend it with theme

## Testing

 - Tested spotyfy and all videos they doing well on all devices
 - If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address.
Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit.
If all field are valid, the page will reload.
 - All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and the CV will download to your default folder for downloads on click using the 'download' attribute.
 - All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.
 - By clicking on the links in the navbar, the scroll effect will work regardless of whether or not you're viewing the sections in the same order they are listed in the dropdown navbar.
 - This site was tested in Chrome and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
 - codes were checked trough Codacy.com
